# Extension Icons

You need to create 3 icon files for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Quick Solution: Use a Placeholder

For testing, you can create simple solid color PNG files with these dimensions.

## Or Use an Icon Generator

1. Go to https://www.favicon-generator.org/
2. Upload any image (like a checkmark icon)
3. Generate and download the icons
4. Rename them to match the filenames above
5. Place them in this `icons/` folder

## Design Suggestion

The icon should represent:
- A checkmark or task completion
- LinkedIn blue (#0a66c2) as the primary color
- Simple and recognizable at small sizes

## Temporary Workaround

The extension will work without icons, but Chrome will show a default placeholder icon instead.
